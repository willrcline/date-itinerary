2. Select a desired date to view relevant events scheduled for that day.

3. Choose a suitable time of day to further customize the itinerary based on your schedule.

4. Specify your preferred type of event from the available dropdown list, which will enable the itinerary planning process to take your interests into account. Additionally, for each event type, a supplementary dropdown list will be provided to further refine your preferences, resulting in a more personalized itinerary that best aligns with your interests.

5. To initiate the creation of an itinerary, select the 'Add to Itinerary' button. This action will trigger the generation of an activity to be pursued.

After obtaining all the necessary information to plan your date, you may proceed to create an entirely new itinerary by inputting a different date, time, and event preferences, which will generate a fresh list of activities. Moreover, while reviewing the new itinerary based on the updated inputs, you may access previously generated itineraries by selecting the 'Past Itinerary' button, which will direct you to a separate page dedicated to previously provided itineraries.
